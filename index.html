        <strong>Summary:</strong> Close Faster, Protect Better<br>
        Every objection gets redirected to this core truth:<br>
        <em>You don’t have enough coverage right now - and we’re fixing that.</em><br>
        The goal: minimize delays, eliminate follow-ups, and close confidently.

        <div class="objection-response">
          "I totally understand, As we talked about, you told me you wanted to be protected right? Currently with (insurance company)  you only have $15,000 in property damage which as we talked about is not enough and in the example we went over with that F-150, you would be stuck paying out of pocket which you said you didn’t want, right? Which is why we gave you the $300,000 to make sure you never have to pay out of pocket.
          <br>So let's make sure you never have to worry about that. What card would you like to use for today’s payment?

      <div class="objection-block">
        <div class="objection-title">Objection 2: “It’s more than I was paying” / “That’s too expensive”</div>
        <div class="objection-response">
          "Totally fair - but let’s break it down. You were paying less because you were getting less. $15,000 in coverage doesn’t cut it. Most of my clients can find the extra ($20,$40,$60) but none of them have an extra $45,000 sitting around.  We’re giving you $300,000 so you don’t have to take a $45,000 hit after an accident.<br>
          Peace of mind costs a little more - but not protecting yourself could cost everything. Let’s get this set up now - what card works best?"

        <div class="objection-response">
          "I totally understand- we have two options, option one which is what I recommend is, lets get this policy started and then we can get you a refund of whatever premium you haven’t used at your current company and if that doesn’t work for you, option two is let’s lock in this upgraded protection now and schedule the first payment for then. You don’t pay anything today, and you’re covered moving forward.”<br>
          “Which option works better for you?”<br>
          (If they choose option two) Which card would you like to use to hold the policy for that date?"

          "Totally understandable - but as we talked about, you said you wanted to be protected and every other company is trying to get you the lowest rates which means they’re going to give you the lowest coverages possible which you said you didn’t want. That’s why over here we gave you the $300,000 to make sure you don’t have to worry about paying anything out of pocket.<br>
          No need to waste time. We’ve already solved the problem. Let’s lock it in - what card would you like to use?"

          "Of course - let me ask you, do you think they’d be more concerned about the price or the coverages?” (this response will many times get them to give up the real objection)<br>
          Let’s get this taken care of. If your partner has questions, we can make changes later - but waiting leaves you vulnerable. What card works best to secure the coverage now?"

You told me you want your insurance to protect you full and right now, you have $15,000 in property damage which in the event we went over with the F-150 would leave you paying $45,000 out of pocket. Over here we gave you the $300,000 to make sure you don’t have to worry about that so let’s get this policy locked in for you. What card would you like to use?”
