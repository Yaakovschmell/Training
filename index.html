          While I pull up your coverages with GEICO, I always like to ask my customers this question: Let’s say you’re driving down the road and you get into an accident where you’re found at fault, and there’s a large damage bill-how much of that bill would you expect your insurance company to cover?

          Absolutely, I agree-and that’s exactly why we have insurance. So now I’m going to go over what you currently have with GEICO so you understand the coverages you actually have.

          The first coverage is bodily injury liability. This covers how much your insurance will pay for the other person’s medical bills if you get into an accident and are found at fault. Right now, you have 30/60, so I’m going to match that coverage the same way.
        </span>

        <span class="script-response">
          The same would apply to your uninsured motorist coverage. This is what protects you and your passengers if you’re ever in an accident and the person who hits you either doesn’t have any insurance, doesn’t have enough insurance, or if it’s a hit-and-run situation. If you or someone in your vehicle is injured, your policy would step in and pay for your medical bills-again, up to the same limits you have for bodily injury: 30/60.

  Property Damage Liability (Most Important Coverage)
</div>

    <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i> Agent:
  </span>
  <span class="script-response" style="font-weight: 600;">
    This is the coverage that pays for the other person’s vehicle or property if you’re at fault in an accident.<br><br>
    <strong>Right now, you only have $15,000 - the state minimum.</strong> That means anything over that amount comes out of your pocket.<br><br>
    <em>For example, are you familiar with the Ford F-150? Do you know about how much they cost?</em><br><br>
    <strong>Customer:</strong> About $60,000.<br><br>
    If you hit a brand-new F-150 and it’s totaled, your current insurance pays $15,000 - <strong>you’d pay the remaining $45,000 out of pocket.</strong><br><br>
    <span style="background:#fde68a; color:#92400e; padding: 6px 12px; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 700; display: inline-block;">
      That’s why we always recommend $300,000 in property damage liability - to make sure you’re fully protected.
    </span><br><br>
    Does that make sense why this coverage is the most important to upgrade?
  </span>
</div>

      <div class="step-title"><i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i> Step 4: Other Important Coverages</div>
      <div class="script-block agent">
        <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
        <span class="script-response">
          The next important coverage is Collision. Collision covers the damage to your own vehicle if you’re in an accident, regardless of who’s at fault-so whether you hit another car, a tree, or even a pole, this is the coverage that helps get your car repaired or replaced.<br><br>
          For collision, I recommend a $1,000 deductible. Here’s why:<br>
          A higher deductible means you’ll be responsible for the first $1,000 of any damage, but it also lowers your monthly premium significantly. Most people don’t get into accidents very often, so choosing a $1,000 deductible is a smart way to keep your insurance affordable while still protecting you from those big, unexpected repair bills. If you ever need to use it, you’ll be glad you have it.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-block agent">
        <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
        <span class="script-response">
          Next is Comprehensive coverage. This protects your vehicle from things that aren’t collision-related-like theft, vandalism, fire, hail, or even hitting an animal. Basically, if something happens to your car that isn’t a crash, comprehensive is what helps you out.<br><br>
          For comprehensive, I recommend a $250 deductible. The reason is, comprehensive claims are usually less expensive and more common-like if a rock cracks your windshield or a storm causes damage. A lower deductible means you’ll pay less out of pocket if something like that happens, and the difference in premium is usually pretty small compared to the collision.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-block agent">
        <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
        <span class="script-response">
          Let’s talk about Roadside Assistance. This is an optional coverage, but it’s one a lot of our customers love. If you ever have a flat tire, run out of gas, lock your keys in your car, or your battery dies, roadside assistance sends help right to you, 24/7. The biggest difference between Allstate’s roadside program and any other insurance company is that Allstate goes off of the drivers rather than the vehicles, meaning no matter what car you’re driving, you would have Allstate roadside covering you.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-block agent">
        <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
        <span class="script-response">
          Another helpful option is Rental Car coverage. This is another optional coverage that most of our client opt in for.  If your car is ever in the shop because of a covered claim-like an accident-this coverage helps pays for a rental car so you can keep getting to work, school, or wherever you need to go. It’s a great way to avoid being stranded or having to pay out of pocket for a rental while your car is being repaired.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-block agent">
        <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
        <span class="script-response">
          Finally, there’s Personal Injury Protection, or PIP. This coverage helps pay for medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, no matter who’s at fault. It can also cover things like lost wages and essential services if you’re unable to work or take care of yourself after an accident. PIP is really valuable because it kicks in quickly and helps cover those immediate costs when you need it most.
        </span>
      </div>

      <div class="step-title"><i class="fa-solid fa-5"></i> Step 5: Wrap-Up</div>

        <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
        <span class="script-response">
          So, by making these adjustments-higher property damage limits, smart deductibles for collision and comprehensive, and adding helpful coverages like roadside, rental, and PIP-you’re making sure you have the protection you need, without overpaying. Does that all make sense? Do you have any questions about any of these coverages?

          "Absolutely, I can email it and send it over via text - but email doesn’t protect you. You told me you want your insurance to protect you full and right now, you have $15,000 in property damage which in the event we went over with the F-150 would leave you paying $45,000 out of pocket. Over here we gave you the $300,000 to make sure you don’t have to worry about that so let’s get this policy locked in for you. What card would you like to use?”
