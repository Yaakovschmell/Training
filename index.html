      <span style="background:#bae6fd; color:#0369a1; padding: 6px 12px; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 700; display: inline-block;">
        “Let’s say you’re driving down the road and you get into an accident where you’re found at fault, and there’s a large damage bill-how much of that bill would you expect your insurance company to cover?”

      Absolutely, I agree-and that’s exactly why we have insurance. So now I’m going to go over what you currently have with GEICO so you understand the coverages you actually have.

      The first coverage is bodily injury liability. This covers how much your insurance will pay for the other person’s medical bills if you get into an accident and are found at fault. Right now, you have 30/60, so I’m going to match that coverage the same way.

    <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>

      The same would apply to your uninsured motorist coverage. This is what protects you and your passengers if you’re ever in an accident and the person who hits you either doesn’t have any insurance, doesn’t have enough insurance, or if it’s a hit-and-run situation. If you or someone in your vehicle is injured, your policy would step in and pay for your medical bills-again, up to the same limits you have for bodily injury: 30/60.

  <span class="script-response" style="font-weight: 600;">
    Now, the next coverage is the one that really concerns me-and here’s why. It’s called property damage liability, and this covers how much your insurance will pay for the other person’s vehicle or property if you're found at fault in an accident.<br><br>
    Currently, you're set at $15,000, which is the state minimum. That means anything over that amount comes out of your pocket.<br><br>
    Just as an example-are you familiar with the Ford F-150?
  </span>
</div>

<div class="script-block customer">
  <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> Customer:</span>
  <span class="script-response" style="font-weight: 600;">
    Yes.

    <i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:

    Do you know around how much they cost?

</div>

<div class="script-block customer">
  <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> Customer:</span>
  <span class="script-response" style="font-weight: 600;">
    About $60,000.
  </span>

    So let’s say you're driving down the road and hit a brand-new F-150, and it gets totaled. With your current policy, GEICO would come to you and say, “You've been a great customer-here’s a check for $15,000.”<br><br>
    Now, the problem is: if it’s a $60,000 truck and they only give you $15,000, how much are you left paying out of pocket? <strong>(MAKE THEM DO THE MATH)</strong>
  </span>
</div>

<div class="script-block customer">
  <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> Customer:</span>
  <span class="script-response" style="font-weight: 600;">

    Exactly! That’s why here, we always give our customers $300,000 in property damage liability, to make sure you’re fully protected in the event of any claim.  Does that make sense why we do that?
  </span>
</div>


  <div class="step-title"><i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i> Step 4: Other Important Coverages</div>
  <div class="script-block agent">
    <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
    <span class="script-response">
      The next important coverage is Collision. Collision covers the damage to your own vehicle if you’re in an accident, regardless of who’s at fault-so whether you hit another car, a tree, or even a pole, this is the coverage that helps get your car repaired or replaced.<br><br>
      For collision, I recommend a $1,000 deductible. Here’s why:<br>
      A higher deductible means you’ll be responsible for the first $1,000 of any damage, but it also lowers your monthly premium significantly. Most people don’t get into accidents very often, so choosing a $1,000 deductible is a smart way to keep your insurance affordable while still protecting you from those big, unexpected repair bills. If you ever need to use it, you’ll be glad you have it.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="script-block agent">
    <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
    <span class="script-response">
      Next is Comprehensive coverage. This protects your vehicle from things that aren’t collision-related-like theft, vandalism, fire, hail, or even hitting an animal. Basically, if something happens to your car that isn’t a crash, comprehensive is what helps you out.<br><br>
      For comprehensive, I recommend a $250 deductible. The reason is, comprehensive claims are usually less expensive and more common-like if a rock cracks your windshield or a storm causes damage. A lower deductible means you’ll pay less out of pocket if something like that happens, and the difference in premium is usually pretty small compared to the collision.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="script-block agent">
    <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
    <span class="script-response">
      Let’s talk about Roadside Assistance. This is an optional coverage, but it’s one a lot of our customers love. If you ever have a flat tire, run out of gas, lock your keys in your car, or your battery dies, roadside assistance sends help right to you, 24/7. The biggest difference between Allstate’s roadside program and any other insurance company is that Allstate goes off of the drivers rather than the vehicles, meaning no matter what car you’re driving, you would have Allstate roadside covering you.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="script-block agent">
    <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
    <span class="script-response">
      Another helpful option is Rental Car coverage. This is another optional coverage that most of our client opt in for. If your car is ever in the shop because of a covered claim-like an accident-this coverage helps pays for a rental car so you can keep getting to work, school, or wherever you need to go. It’s a great way to avoid being stranded or having to pay out of pocket for a rental while your car is being repaired.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="script-block agent">
    <span class="script-role"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i> Agent:</span>
    <span class="script-response">
      Finally, there’s Personal Injury Protection, or PIP. This coverage helps pay for medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, no matter who’s at fault. It can also cover things like lost wages and essential services if you’re unable to work or take care of yourself after an accident. PIP is really valuable because it kicks in quickly and helps cover those immediate costs when you need it most.

      So, by making these adjustments-higher property damage limits, smart deductibles for collision and comprehensive, and adding helpful coverages like roadside, rental, and PIP-you’re making sure you have the protection you need, without overpaying. Does that all make sense? Do you have any questions about any of these coverages?

    While my system is calculating your rate, let me tell you a little bit about our agency.<br><br>

    First, we’re a local agency. That means if you ever have questions or problems, you won’t be stuck in a call center or waiting on hold. You’ll speak directly to the same few people every time-real people who know you and your policy.<br><br>

    We pride ourselves on clear communication. You’ll get my office number and email, plus my personal cell phone number for after-hours questions or emergencies. So, anytime you need help, you have direct access to us.<br><br>

    Also, unlike companies like GEICO, Progressive, and Liberty Mutual, we don’t do teaser rates. Many big companies start you off with a low rate but can legally raise it at any time after you sign up. Here, we’ve already run all your underwriting reports, so your rate is locked in. Plus, 45 days before your renewal, our customer service team will call you to review your policy, ensure you’re getting all your discounts, and make sure you always have the best rate possible.<br><br>

    So, (Prospect), when we started, I asked how much you would want your insurance to cover if you got into an accident and were found at fault. You said all of it-is that still right?<br><br>

    Right now, with GEICO, you’re only covered for the first $15,000. If you hit that Ford F-150 we talked about, you’d be responsible for the remaining $45,000-and you told me that’s something you want to avoid, right?<br><br>

    That’s why we provided you with $300,000 in coverage-to make sure you’re properly protected in case of any accident.<br><br>

    So, your monthly payment for this full protection will be ($).<br><br>

    A couple more questions and we’ll wrap this up:<br>
    Who is the vehicle financed through?<br>
    And what card would you like to use for today’s payment?

      "I totally understand, As we talked about, you told me you wanted to be protected right? Currently with (insurance company) you only have $15,000 in property damage which as we talked about is not enough and in the example we went over with that F-150, you would be stuck paying out of pocket which you said you didn’t want, right? Which is why we gave you the $300,000 to make sure you never have to pay out of pocket.<br>
      So let's make sure you never have to worry about that. What card would you like to use for today’s payment?

    <div class="objection-response-dropdown">
      "Totally fair - but let’s break it down. You were paying less because you were getting less. $15,000 in coverage doesn’t cut it. Most of my clients can find the extra ($20,$40,$60) but none of them have an extra $45,000 sitting around. We’re giving you $300,000 so you don’t have to take a $45,000 hit after an accident.<br>
      Peace of mind costs a little more - but not protecting yourself could cost everything. Let’s get this set up now - what card works best?"

You don’t pay anything today, and you’re covered moving forward.”<br>

    <blockquote style="background:#f8fafc; border-left:4px solid #38bdf8; padding:1em; border-radius:6px;">
      “The reason I’m pulling this up is because most people qualify for a pretty big multi-policy discount when we combine auto and home.

  <h4 style="color:#16a34a;">✅ Assumptive Selling Tips for Agents</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t ask if they want the other quote - assume they’ll benefit from it.</li>
    <li>Use phrases like:
      <ul>
        <li>“I’m going to go ahead and pull that up now.”</li>
        <li>“We’ll bundle this in to maximize your discounts.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Link every cross-sell to either:
      <ul>
        <li>Savings</li>
        <li>Better protection</li>
        <li>One-stop convenience</li>
