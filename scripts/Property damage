Insurance Sales Script
Agent:
So, [Customer Name], I’m going to pull up your current coverages so I can see what you have. I see you’re currently with [Insurance Company]. How’s your overall experience been with them-the rates, customer service, things like that?

Agent:
While I pull up your coverages with GEICO, I always like to ask my customers this question: Let’s say you’re driving down the road and you get into an accident where you’re found at fault, and there’s a large damage bill-how much of that bill would you expect your insurance company to cover?

Customer:
All of it.

Agent:
Absolutely, I agree-and that’s exactly why we have insurance. So now I’m going to go over what you currently have with GEICO so you understand the coverages you actually have.

Agent:
The first coverage is bodily injury liability. This covers how much your insurance will pay for the other person’s medical bills if you get into an accident and are found at fault. Right now, you have 30/60, so I’m going to match that coverage the same way.

Agent:
The same thing applies to your own medical bills if someone hits you and they either don’t have insurance, don’t have enough insurance, or if it’s a hit-and-run. If you or someone in your vehicle is hurt, we would pay for your medical bills-same coverage limits as before: 30/60.

Agent:
Now, the next coverage is the one that really concerns me-and here’s why. It’s called property damage liability, and this covers how much your insurance will pay for the other person’s vehicle or property if you're found at fault in an accident.

Currently, you're set at $15,000, which is the state minimum. That means anything over that amount comes out of your pocket.

Just as an example-are you familiar with the Ford F-150?

Customer:
Yes.

Agent:
Do you know around how much they cost?

Customer:
About $60,000.

Agent:
So let’s say you're driving down the road and hit a brand-new F-150, and it gets totaled. With your current policy, GEICO would come to you and say, “You've been a great customer-here’s a check for $15,000.”

Now, the problem is: if it’s a $60,000 truck and they only give you $15,000, how much are you left paying out of pocket?

Customer:
$45,000.

Agent:
And how does that sound?

Customer:
Horrible.

Agent:
Exactly! That’s why here, we always give our customers $300,000 in property damage liability, to make sure you’re fully protected in the event of any claim. Does that make sense?

Customer:
Yes.
